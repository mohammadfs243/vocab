They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t\nhold with such nonsense.\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which\nmade drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin\nand blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which\ncame in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over\ngarden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small\nson called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a\nsecret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.",

Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met\nfor several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a\nsister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as\nunDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to\nthink what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the\nstreet. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but\nthey had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason\nfor keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with\na child like that.\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday\nour story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to\nsuggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his\nmost boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily\nas she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the\nwindow.\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked\nMrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but\nmissed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing\nhis cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left\nthe house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s\ndrive.\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\nsomething peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr.\nDursley didn’t realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head\naround to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner",

It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in\nhis mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no,\nlooking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley\ngave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he\ndrove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of\ndrills he was hoping to get that day.\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by\nsomething else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he\ncouldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely\ndressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear\npeople who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you saw on\nyoung people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He\ndrummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a\nhuddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a\ncouple of them weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older\nthan he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of\nhim! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some\nsilly stunt — these people were obviously collecting for something . . . yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few\nminutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot,\nhis mind back on drills.\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office\non the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to\nconcentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping",

It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man\nwas wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a\nwide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare,\n“Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!

He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he\nlooked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from\nthe other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat\nseemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have\nknown.”\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It\nseemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up\nin the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a\nlittle pop. He clicked it again — the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights\nleft on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance,\nwhich were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out\nof their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn’t\nbe able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement.\nDumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set\noff down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the\nwall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he\nspoke to it.\n“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”\nHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was\nsmiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square\nglasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its\neyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair\nwas drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\n“How did you know it was me?” she asked.\n“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.”",

Hope you’re well.\nHagrid\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in\nits beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm.\nThen he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as\ntalking on the telephone.\nHarry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.\n“Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon,\nstill ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.\n“He’s not going,” he said.\nHagrid grunted.\n“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he said.\n“A what?” said Harry, interested.",

But for my mother\nand father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of\nhaving a witch in the family!”\nShe stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It\nseemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.\n“Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you’d be just the same, just\nas strange, just as — as — abnormal — and then, if you please, she\nwent and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!”\nHarry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he\nsaid, “Blown up?

Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so\nstrange, somehow.\n“You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid.\nHarry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the best birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his hamburger, trying to\nfind the words.\n“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All those people in\nthe Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander . . . but I\ndon’t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great\nthings? I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m famous for.\nI don’t know what happened when Vol-, sorry — I mean, the night\nmy parents died.”\nHagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.\n“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone\nstarts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard.\nBut yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, ’smatter of fact.”",

Draco Malfoy looked at him.\n“Think my name’s funny, do you?

A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside\nthe front door.\nWhen Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid’s voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.”\nHagrid’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the\ndoor open.\n“Hang on,” he said. “Back, Fang.”\nHe let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an\nenormous black boarhound.\nThere was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were\nhanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open\nfire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt\nover it.\n“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who\nbounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid,\nFang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.\n“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.\n“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s freckles.\n“I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.”\nThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost\nbroke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying\nthem as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons.

Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in\nfact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault\nseven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out\nthat grubby little package.

If he finds all three of us I’ll tell him the truth, that I was\ntrying to stop you, and you can back me up.”\n“You’ve got some nerve —” said Ron loudly.\n“Shut up, both of you!” said Harry sharply. “I heard something.”\nIt was a sort of snuffling.\n“Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.\nIt wasn’t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the\nfloor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.\n“Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for hours, I\ncouldn’t remember the new password to get in to bed.”\n“Keep your voice down, Neville. The password’s ‘Pig snout’ but\nit won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone off somewhere.”\n“How’s your arm?” said Harry.\n“Fine,” said Neville, showing them. “Madam Pomfrey mended\nit in about a minute.”",

Cups, shields,\nplates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They\nedged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end\nof the room.

Disgusted that the Slytherins had\nlost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed\ntree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he’d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking\nbroomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.\nIt was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet Drive for\nChristmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn’t feel sorry for\nhimself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he’d ever\nhad. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs.\nWeasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.\nWhen they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found\na large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead.

If she was really there, he’d touch\nher, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air —\nshe and the others existed only in the mirror.\nShe was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her\neyes — her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little\ncloser to the glass. Bright green — exactly the same shape, but then\nhe noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same\ntime. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his\narm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It\nstuck up at the back, just as Harry’s did.\nHarry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly\ntouching that of his reflection.",

He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.\nHow long he stood there, he didn’t know. The reflections did\nnot fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought\nhim back to his senses. He couldn’t stay here, he had to find his way\nback to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother’s face, whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the room.\n“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly.\n“You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show you the\nmirror.”\n“I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly.\n“And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you’ll be able\nto show me your other brothers and everyone.”\n“You can see them any old time,” said Ron. “Just come round\nmy house this summer.

I’ve never heard of such a thing before! You,\nMiss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of\nyou will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom,\nnothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it’s very dangerous — and fifty points will be\ntaken from Gryffindor.”",

He landed, sprawled next to Harry.\n“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.\n“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break\nthe fall. Come on, Hermione!”\nThe distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog,\nbut Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other\nside.\n“We must be miles under the school,” she said.\n“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.\n“Lucky!” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”\nShe leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to\nstruggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started\nto twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and\nRon, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers\nwithout their noticing.\nHermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a\nfirm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought\nto pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the\ntighter and faster the plant wound around them.\n“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this\nis — it’s Devil’s Snare!”\n“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,”\nsnarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling\naround his neck.",

In a matter of seconds,\nthe two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the\nlight and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from\ntheir bodies, and they were able to pull free.\n“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry\nas he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\n“Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.”\n“This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which\nwas the only way forward.\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip\nof water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant\njolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding\nvaults in the wizards’ bank.

It was\nfull of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around\nthe room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy\nwooden door.\n“Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” said Ron.\n“Probably,” said Harry. “They don’t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once . . . well, there’s no other\nchoice . . .

At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across\nHarry’s scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he\nyelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let\ngo of him. The pain in his head lessened — he looked around\nwildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in\npain, looking at his fingers — they were blistering before his eyes.\n“Seize him! SEIZE HIM!” shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of\nhim, both hands around Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost\nblinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.",
